# DSC 530 Final Project
# Abstract
A PowerPoint presentation outlining your statistical question/hypothesis. A minimum of 5 variables in your dataset used during your analysis. Describing what the 5 variables mean in the dataset. I included a histogram of each of the 5 variables in summary and analysis, identified any outliers and explained the reasoning for them being outliers and how you believe they should be handled. Include the other descriptive characteristics about the variables: Mean, Mode, Spread, and Tails.

I was also comparing two scenarios in my data. I Created 1 CDF with one of your variables, what does this tell you about your variable and how does it address the question you are trying to answer. Plotting 1 analytical distribution and provide your analysis on how it applies to the dataset. I created two scatter plots comparing two variables and provided a analysis on correlation and causation. I also looked at covariance, Pearson’s correlation, and Non-Linear Relationships in my analysis. For this project, I conducted a regression analysis on one dependent, one explanatory variable, and multiple explanatory variables.

# Findings
Since the data is from the 1980’s, I wondered if the data would show strong causation over the decades. I also wondered if doing time series analysis on this data would shows new patterns or confirm trends that were found in the original data.

# Challenges
I did noticed after making the regression coefficients and when I used the data to test back into the regression model. The prediction of the regression model is not great but, I know that the model needs more time to train. 

# Conclusion
From my initial analysis, I saw a correlation between the median home value and the lower status population variables. Later on, I noticed that there were many factors connected the median home value variable. Relying only on the median home value would not give a picture of the data.
