# DSC530_Final_Project_Summer_2019
A PowerPoint presentation outlining your statistical question/hypothesis. A minimum of 5 variables in your dataset used during your analysis. Describing what the 5 variables mean in the dataset. Included a histogram of each of the 5 variables – in my summary and analysis, identified any outliers and explained the reasoning for them being outliers and how you believe they should be handled. Include the other descriptive characteristics about the variables: Mean, Mode, Spread, and Tails.

comparing two scenarios in your data using a PMF. It is the same variable, but a different scenario. Almost like a filter. The example in the book is first babies compared to all other babies, it is still the same variable, but breaking the data out based on criteria we are exploring.

Created 1 CDF with one of your variables, what does this tell you about your variable and how does it address the question you are trying to answer.

Plotting 1 analytical distribution and provide your analysis on how it applies to the dataset. Create two scatter plots comparing two variables and provide your analysis on correlation and causation. Remember, covariance, Pearson’s correlation, and Non-Linear Relationships should also be considered during your analysis.

Conducting a test on your hypothesis. For this project, conducted a regression analysis on either one dependent and one explanatory variable, or multiple explanatory variables.



A 250-500-word paper summarizing the following:


Statistical/Hypothetical Question

Outcome of your EDA

What do you feel was missed during the analysis?

Were there any variables you felt could have helped in the analysis?

Were there any assumptions made you felt were incorrect?

What challenges did you face, what did you not fully understand?
